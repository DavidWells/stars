# Bookclub Builder - Frontend

## Motivation

Bookclub Builder's goal is to encourage people to read more and unite book lovers. I wanted a simple website that allowed me to create a bookclub and decide on which books to read through poll. [This](https://github.com/Taljjaa/bookclub-builder-backend) is a link to the backend repository

## Technology Used

-  React (with Hooks!)
-  Redux
-  Material UI
-  AWS S3 image hosting
-  Google Books API
-  [React-Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify)

## Features

-  Users can sign up and login
-  Users can join a bookclub or leave a bookclub
   -  As a member a user can vote on the current poll
-  Users can create a bookclub
   -  If you create the bookclub you're automatically set as the admin
      -  As the admin you can create a poll and archive the poll
      -  And Edit the bookclub

## Installation

run `npm install` and then `npm start` to begin the server. Make sure the backend is running too.
