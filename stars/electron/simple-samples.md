# Electron Samples

Sample Electron applications with ideas for taking them further.

## Getting Started

The first thing to do is install Node.js, if you haven't already. The easiest
way to do that is by visiting [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and downloading
the installer, which will set up `node` and `npm` for you.

Once you've got that out of the way, clone the repository. If you're new to
git, check out the
[guide to cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/electron/simple-samples
```

Each folder contains a different app with its own `README.md` file
explaining what it does, how to run it, and how it could be improved.

## Caveat

This repository is meant as a tool for learning Electron by taking an
existing application further by using additional Electron APIs.

It is intended for people who are not only new to Electron but
somewhat new to web development as well. With that in mind, we used approachable
tools like jQuery and Bootstrap to keep the barrier to entry as low as
possible.
