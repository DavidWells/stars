# [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) GraphQL Design Tutorial

This tutorial was originally created by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/) for internal
purposes. We've created a public version of it since we think it's useful to
anyone creating a GraphQL API.

It's based on lessons learned from creating and evolving production schemas at
Shopify over almost 3 years. The tutorial has evolved and will continue to
change in the future so nothing is set in stone.

We believe these design guidelines work in most cases. They may not all work
for you. Even within the company we still question them and have exceptions
since most rules can't apply 100% of the time. So don't just blindly copy and
implement all of them. Pick and choose which ones make sense for you and your
use cases.

Read the [full tutorial here](TUTORIAL.md). It's also been translated by the community into [a few other languages](lang).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome; however, this tutorial reflects rules specific to Shopify and
any substantial changes to those will primarily happen internally and not through external contributions.

Corrections and additional translations are welcome in the [`lang` folder](lang).
