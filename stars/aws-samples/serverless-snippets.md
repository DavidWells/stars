This repo contains Serverless Snippets that you can copy to help develop your own projects.

These snippets are hosted on [Serverless Land](https://serverlessland.com/snippets).

## Why Serverless Snippets was created?

Across the community and internet there are hundreds of examples of how to use AWS Services with code, tutorials and examples. Often developers are repeating small tasks going back to previous local code snippets and reusing them. 

This collection on [ServerlessLand](https://serverlessland.com) is designed to help engineers share useful code with each other.

With Serverless Snippets engineers can find, explore and filter snippets, and as contributions grow we hope Severless Snippets can simplify your development experince.
