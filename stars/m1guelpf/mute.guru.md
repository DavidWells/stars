# Take back your Twitter feed
> Obliterate all ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡'s from your feed with one-click, and go back to enjoying the content you actually care about.

mute.guru is a simple application displaying a crowdsourced list of the worst engagement farmers on Twitter, and allows users to mute all of them with a single click (and granularly mute/unmute each of them).

## Acknowledgments

The site's design is _heavily_ inspired by [mute.vc](https://mute.vc), a similar site to mute investors.

Also, the inspiration for building this came from [@jmduke's tweet](https://twitter.com/jmduke/status/1563910836355182592) requesting an app like this (and even suggesting the domain).

## Privacy

I had to use Twitters v1.1 API (v2 has the required methods, but much stricter rate-limits). Because of this, the tokens acquired have write access to everything but DMs (write tweets, follow users, etc.). To reduce risk, the tokens aren't saved on a database, and are instead only present on the user's device via an encrypted cookie.
