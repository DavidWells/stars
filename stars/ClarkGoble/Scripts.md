Scripts
=======

These are my shared scripts. They are primarily written using python and appscript. Most of them are discussed at 
my blog www.libertypages.com/clarktech and are focused on my own personal workflow. The applications I script
the most are MarsEdit, Safari, Mail, BBEdit, Address Book and NetNewsWire. I often use them in combination
with a macro utility like Quickeys or Keyboard Maestro. All of these are oriented around effective workflows.
I'm storing them here so I can update them without having to update each blog post about them. Hopefully I'll
slowly move all my scripts here.

At the top of each script should be a link to the post that discusses them.

You should consider these scripts to be more templates for writing your own scripts. I see this more as resource
I'm sharing with others rather than finished products. Everyones' needs are unique. So please feel free to take
these and apply them to your own ends.
