- üîß Simple configuration management
- üîå Seamless Claude Desktop integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed

### Download and Run Toolbase
> Toolbase currently only supports macOS. Support for Windows and Linux in active development.

1. Download the latest version of Toolbase from [https://gettoolbase.ai](https://gettoolbase.ai)
2. Open the application and start using tools and plugins with Claude Desktop

## Project Structure

```
toolbase/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/      # Desktop application for tool management
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ runner/   # Secure local runner for MCP servers

```

This monorepo contains two main packages:

- `packages/app` - Desktop application for tool management and configuration, built with Electron
- `packages/runner` - Local runner for executing MCP servers and tools, built with Deno

See individual package READMEs for detailed documentation:

- [Desktop App Documentation](packages/app/README.md)
- [Runner Documentation](packages/runner/README.md)

## Development Setup

Although setup as a monorepo, each package are managed independently.

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Toolbase-AI/toolbase.git
cd toolbase
```

### Desktop App (`packages/app`)

The desktop application is built with Electron and provides the main user interface.

- [Desktop App Documentation](packages/app/README.md)

#### Prequisites
- Node 22
- npm

```bash
cd packages/app
npm install

# Run the Electron development application

### Runner (`packages/runner`)

The runner is a Deno CLI and library that executes MCP servers locally to provide tools and plugins to Claude Desktop and other AI platforms. This will be built into a binary to run on the user's local devices. 

- [Runner Documentation](packages/runner/README.md)

#### Prequisites
- Deno 2

```bash
cd packages/runner
