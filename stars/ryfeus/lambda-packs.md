3. Blank function
4. Configure triggers - Next
5. Configure function
  - Runtime - Python 2.7

### Selenium PhantomJS

#### Intro

Selenium on PhantomJS. In fact - a ready-made tool for web scraping. For example, the demo now opens a random page in Wikipedia and sends its header. (PhantomJS at the same time disguises itself as a normal browser, knows how to log in, click and fill out forms) Also added requests, so you can do API requests for different resources to discard / take away the information.

Useful for web testing and scraping.

#### Demo

Current demo opens random page from wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) and prints title.

#### Serverless start

```
git clone https://github.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs.git
cd lambda-packs/Selenium_PhantomJS/source/
serverless deploy
serverless invoke --function main --log
```

You can also see the results from the API Gateway endpoint in a web browser.

### Pyresttest + WRK

#### Intro

What does the lambda have to do with it? In a nutshell on AWS in one region you can simultaneously run 200 lambdas (more if you write to support). Lambda works in 11 regions. So you can run in parallel more than 2000 lambdas, each of which will conduct load testing of your service. Five minutes of such testing will cost just one dollar.

#### Demo

Demo in this package tries to send requests to github.com for 5 seconds with 1 connection and also conduct pyresttest dummy test.

#### Tools

1. WRK (https://github.com/wg/wrk) - the main tool for load testing. It works with multiple threads, you can specify the number of connections and length of the load. For more fine-tuning, you can use LuaJIT scripts (https://www.lua.org/).
2. Pyrestest (https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest) is a handy tool for testing the full pipeline of the API. For example, the user registers, then uses the api key to create tasks / make notes / downloads files, then reads them, then deletes them.

### Lxml + requests

#### Intro

Package for parsing static HTML pages. Difference here is that it works faster and consumes less memory than PhantomJS but is limited in terms websites it can parse and other features.

#### Serverless start

```
serverless install -u https://github.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs/tree/master/Lxml_requests/source -n lxml-requests
cd lxml-requests
serverless deploy
serverless invoke --function main --log
```

#### Build pack

```
wget https://github.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs/blob/master/Lxml_requests/buildPack.sh
docker pull amazonlinux:latest
docker run -v $(pwd):/outputs --name lambdapackgen -d amazonlinux:latest tail -f /dev/null
docker exec -i -t lambdapackgen /bin/bash /outputs/buildPack.sh
```

#### Tools

Lxml 3.7.1

#### Documentation

http://lxml.de/

### Tensorflow

#### Intro 

Open source library for Machine Intelligence. Basically revolutionized AI and made it more accessible. Using tensorflow on lambda is not as bad as it may sound - for some simple models it is the simplest and the cheapest way to deploy.

#### Demo

As hello world code I used recognition of images trained on imagenet (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition). Given the price tag lambda one run (recognition of one picture) will cost $0.00005. Therefore for a dollar you can recognize 20,000 images. It is much cheaper than almost any alternatives, though completely scalable (200 functions can be run in parallel), and can be easily integrated into cloud infrastructure. Current demo downloads image from link 'imagelink' from event source ( if empty - then downloads https://s3.amazonaws.com/ryfeuslambda/tensorflow/imagenet/cropped_panda.jpg)

#### Tools

Tensorflow 1.4.0

#### Documentation

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition

#### Nightly version

Nightly version archive is more than 50 MB in size but it is still eligible for using with AWS Lambda (though you need to upload pack through S3). For more read here:

https://hackernoon.com/exploring-the-aws-lambda-deployment-limits-9a8384b0bec3

#### Serverless start

```
serverless install -u https://github.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs/tree/master/tensorflow/source -n tensorflow
cd tensorflow
serverless deploy
serverless invoke --function main --log
```

#### Build pack

for Python2:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs/master/Tensorflow/buildPack.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs/master/Tensorflow/index.py
docker pull amazonlinux:latest
docker run -v $(pwd):/outputs --name lambdapackgen -d amazonlinux:latest tail -f /dev/null
docker exec -i -t lambdapackgen /bin/bash /outputs/buildPack.sh
```

for Python3:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs/master/Tensorflow/buildPack_py3.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryfeus/lambda-packs/master/Tensorflow/index_py3.py
docker pull amazonlinux:latest
docker run -v $(pwd):/outputs --name lambdapackgen -d amazonlinux:latest tail -f /dev/null
docker exec -i -t lambdapackgen /bin/bash /outputs/buildPack_py3.sh
```

> Note: Remember You should set `python3.6` for AWS Lambda function environment.

### Satellite imagery processing (rasterio + OSGEO + pyproj + shapely + PIL)

#### Intro

AWS Lambda pack in Python for processing satellite imagery. Basically it enables to deploy python code in an easy and cheap way for processing satellite imagery or polygons. In “hello world” code of the pack I download red, green, blue Landsat 8 bands from AWS, make True Color image out of it and upload it to S3. It takes 35 seconds and 824MB of RAM for it so ~2500 scenes can be processed for 1$.
