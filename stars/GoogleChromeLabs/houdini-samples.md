# Houdini Samples

Samples for the specifications of the [Houdini task force].

[Houdini task force]: https://wiki.css-houdini.org/

Each sample has its own folder with a link to a video showing that sample, as
no vendor has published a version of their browser with support for any of
the Houdini standards yet.
