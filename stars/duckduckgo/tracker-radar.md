# DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar

This is not a block list, but a data set of the most common third party domains on the web with information about their behavior, classification and ownership. It allows for easy custom solutions with the significant metadata it has for each domain: parent entity, prevalence, use of fingerprinting, cookies, privacy policy, and performance. The data on individual domains can be found in the [domains](/domains) directory.
