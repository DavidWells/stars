# serverless-micro

[Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com) plugin to help manage multiple micro services under one main service.  

## Deprecated

This framework is deprecated and we no longer reccomend using it. It breaks a lot of AWS features and we will be phasing it out of our serverless stack at Barstool.
