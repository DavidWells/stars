<a name="about"/>
### What is this project about?
People all over the internet are using
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) in more and more creative
ways to build all sort of useful things, ranging from infrastructure
automation to deployment solutions, business intelligence to almost
full fledged http endpoints and REST services respectively without
running any servers.

We thought it would be a cool idea to collect and curate all of this
content and write a little eBook about Lambda and all the cool use
cases that people are building with it.

The book will be organized in 50 chapters with each one belonging to
one category such as Infrastructure Management, Monitoring + Logging,
Application Services, etc. Use-Cases and complexity will be very
diverse, ranging from small (What is my IP?) to big Lambda functions
(Thumbnailing), from simple (EBS Snapshot) to complex use cases
(Ray-tracing high-quality images in the cloud) that involve more
services.

The eBook will be free, open sourced on Github at
https://github.com/arafato/50-Shades-of-Lambda and published via
Leanpub at https://leanpub.com/fifty-shades-of-lambda. Any royalties
will be donated.
