# SingleFileZ

It's the end of an adventure, but that's not bad news! SingleFileZ has been completely merged into [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile). 

See the section "File format" in the options page of SingleFile to save pages as self-extracting files. Alternatively, you can simply import your existing settings in SingleFile.
