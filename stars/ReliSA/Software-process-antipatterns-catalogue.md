# Software process antipatterns catalogue

We started this catalogue to collect and consolidate the knowledge of software project management anti-patterns, as commonly occurring solutions with known negative effects, and furthermore to facilitate their detection by analyzing data of projects.  It is an on-going effort with the aim to to create a space where others can contribute and thus together we can reconcile the various sources and foster community discussion on understanding and descriptions of the individual anti-patterns. So feel free to fork this repository and send us pull requests when you have something to contribute.

## [Antipatterns catalogue](Antipatterns_catalogue.md)

The catalogue proper, including [the template](catalogue/template.md) used in anti-pattern description.

## [References](References.md)

Literature and online sources used to gather the anti-patterns.

## Notes

The original contents of the catalogue (as of 2019) is based on a review of academic, professional and grey literature sources to collect the currently known and defined software PM anti-patterns.  It uses a description template designed to support data-driven detection of anti-pattern occurrence, e.g. using our [SPADe toolset](https://github.com/ReliSA/SPADe). 

For easier catalog management, we provide the application in this repository, including its complete [documentation](app/doc/Documentation.md).
