# 📚 Introduction

This project was built following the architecture and patterns of production-ready Serverless applications. It simulates the back-end of Twitter, featuring the main functionalities of the application. <br />

The entire application was built using Cloud-Native services provided by AWS.

# 👨🏽‍🔧 Tech stack

* 🏡 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/what-is-appsync.html">AWS AppSync</a> - provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP REST APIs.
* 👷🏻 <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwi65ZOUsO_wAhVBgJEKHUiuDwIYABABGgJjZQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_1WI4JrkomIsRl4pzEy7HCKyY1qNQ&q=&ved=2ahUKEwjKh4yUsO_wAhWCJ7kGHYXxB8oQqyQoAHoECAEQEQ&adurl=">AWS Lambda</a> - serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.
* 🗃️ <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html">AWS DynamoDB</a> - fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
* 👮🏻 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html">AWS Cognito</a> - provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps.
* 🍃 <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless Framework</a> - framework that speeds up the development of Serverless cloud-native applications.
* 🚒 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/">Kinesis Firehose</a> - is an extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that reliably captures, transforms, and delivers streaming data to data lakes, data stores, and analytics services.
* 🔍 <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> - search-as-a-service platform similar to Elasticsearch.
