# [localFont](http://jaicab.com/localFont/)
Implement localStorage web font caching in seconds.

Read [the article](http://jaicab.com/2015/03/03/introducing-localfont-a-localstorage-solution/).

localFont is an online Vanilla JS tool that converts your font family files into a ready to use solution for localStorage web font caching.

Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/jaicab/localFont/issues/new), [send me a pull request](https://github.com/jaicab/localFont/compare/) or [fire me a tweet](https://twitter.com/jaicab_).

## Credits
This tool wouldn't have been possible without the help of:
- Vitaly Friedman for [Smashing Magazine's launcher script](https://gist.github.com/hdragomir/8f00ce2581795fd7b1b7)
- Jon Leighton for his [amazing base64 encoding function](https://gist.github.com/jonleighton/958841)
