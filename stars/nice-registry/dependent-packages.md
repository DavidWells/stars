# dependent-packages

Offline collection of the dependents and devDependents of every package in the npm registry.

⚠️ HEY ⚠️

This package weighs in at around 450MB!
It's kind of big and takes a while to install,
as it unpacks over 100,000 small JSON files.
For a lightweight alternative that just contains
counts and not the actual dependent package names,
try the [dependent-counts](http://ghub.io/dependent-counts)
module. It's only 7MB.

:v:

## Installation

```sh
npm install npm-dependency-stats --save
```

## Usage

```js
const {directDependents, directDevDependents} = require('dependent-packages')

directDependents('express')
// all package names that have express listed in `dependencies`

directDevDependents('cheerio')
// all package names that have cheerio listed in `devDependencies`
```

## Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

## Dependencies

- [decompress](): Extracting archives made easy
- [package-stream](): An endless stream of clean package data from the npm registry.

## Dev Dependencies

- [lodash.uniq](): The lodash method `_.uniq` exported as a module.
- [mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp): Recursively mkdir, like `mkdir -p`
- [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all): A CLI tool to run multiple npm-scripts in parallel or sequential.
- [package-stream](): An endless stream of clean package data from the npm registry.
- [path-exists](): Check if a path exists
- [require-dir](https://github.com/aseemk/requireDir): Helper to require() directories.
