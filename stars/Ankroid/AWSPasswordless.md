## Amazon Cognito Passwordless Email Auth

This is the _**sample**_ code that comes together with [the blog post on passwordless e-mail auth in Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/implementing-passwordless-email-authentication-with-amazon-cognito/).

The purpose of this sample code is to demonstrate how Amazon Cognito Custom Authentication Flows can be used to implement passwordless e-mail auth. Please treat the code as an _**illustration**_––thoroughly review it and adapt it to your needs, if you want to use it for serious things.

The sample code is contained in these folders. Please visit these and run the sample solution:

- [./cognito](./cognito): a Serverless Application that includes a Cognito user pool with the necessary setup
- [./client](./client): a Web Client that authenticates with the Cognito user pool
