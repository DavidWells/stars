:evergreen_tree: This action provide a comment that displays the diff of the pull request in a tree format.

## Motivation

When we develop a product, we make various changes to the code base. For example, add, remove, edit, and rename files.

The code diffs can be seen on GitHub's excellent review page. However, the directory structure of the changed files is sometimes overlooked by reviewers.

Therefore, this Action was created with the goal of improving the accuracy of the review by visualizing the directory structure of diffs included in a pull request in a Human-Readable format.

## Usage

See [action.yml](./action.yml)

**Basic:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-diff-tree.yml
name: 'PR Diff Tree'

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  dump:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: wadackel/github-pr-diff-tree@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
