###  ⚠️ Important notes

 1. **Consider this library as a work-in-progress** (at least until version 3 which will be a more stable release).
 2. Currently, this library doesn't provide default CSS styles. So, you're required to write
 your own CSS styles. You can also copy the styles from the demo page (see [`docs.css` after `Line 433`](https://github.com/bhch/react-json-form/blob/master/docs/static/css/docs.css#L433)) as a starting point.
 3. Be prepared for breaking changes regarding UI structure and CSS class names. Currently, CSS class names don't
 follow a particular naming standard. But this will change in v3.
 4. Support for UI themes will be added soon.
