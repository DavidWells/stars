DOMListener
======================

DOMListener is a simple tool that provides convenient interface for observing DOM changes (node removal and addition, attribute and text modifications). Events can be filtered with ease, affected nodes can be highlighted with a single click.

Installation
-----

You can get this extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domlistener/jlfdgnlpibogjanomigieemaembjeolj) or [download it from github](https://github.com/kdzwinel/DOMListenerExtension/archive/master.zip) and manually load as an 'Unpacked extension' via chrome extensions page.

Usage
-----

Open Chrome DevTools and navigate to the "DOMListener" panel. From here you can:

- start listening/recording DOM changes ("Record" button),
- filter types of events using checkboxes in the top left corner,
- filter nodes by providing a search query in the input field,
- highlight nodes by clicking on their names and
- inspect nodes by holding Shift and clicking on their names.
