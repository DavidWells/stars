# 1up Health App

The Open Source Ai System to make you live Longer, Sharper and Better

We are currently focusing on our iOS Build

Initial integrations:

- Apple Health (Apple Watch Data)
- Oura ring (API Access)
- Whoop strap (API Access)
- UltraHuman Ring (requires applying to waitlist for sdk)

to run in dev mode:

1. Ensure you have XCode installed on your system with a version of iPhone IOS downloaded
2. run `pnpm install` in the root of the repo
3. go into `apps/mobile`
4. run `npx pod-install`
5. run `pnpm ios`
6. this will take a while to build the app on your machine, and should start an iOS simulator after
