## Why another invoice generator

This project was made for our own company [Crisp](https:/crisp.chat/). We are generating everymonth thousands of HTML invoices. Given this scale, using Puppeteer for generating HTML to PDF would be very inefficient.

As everyday, our customers were asking for PDF invoices as some accounting softwares automatically fetch invoices from emails. I could really understand their frustration. At the end, why generating PDF should be easy?
