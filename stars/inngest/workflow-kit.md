# Workflow kit

**Workflow Kit** enables you to build user-defined workflows with Inngest by providing a set of workflow actions to the **[Workflow Engine](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/workflow-kit/engine?ref=github-workflow-kit-readme)** while using the **[pre-built React components](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/workflow-kit/components-api?ref=github-workflow-kit-readme)** to build your Workflow Editor UI.

## Installation

Workflow kit requires the [Inngest TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js) as a dependency. You can install both via `npm` or similar:

```shell {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install @inngest/workflow-kit inngest
```
