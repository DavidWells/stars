EDD Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

[View the full site here](http://library.easydigitaldownloads.com)

Using the full site (link above) instead of browsing this repository is recommended.

**Important:** Snippets are not actively maintained or supported. Use at your own risk.
