Jam icons is a set of SVG icons designed for web projects, illustrations, print projects, etc. Licensed under MIT.
Icons: [https://jam-icons.com](https://jam-icons.com)

## What's new?

Support for font and JS has been dropped to focus on SVG only (v3). The idea is to simplify the current package, believing that SVG / inline SVG is the principal way to go when it comes to web icons.

## Usage

#### Full list

The complete icons list is available on [https://jam-icons.com](https://jam-icons.com).
You'll be able to either download the SVG file or copy the markup when hovering an icon.

#### Download Set

Hit the **download** button to download the full set.

## Support

If you have some icons ideas, please open a new **issue**. Thanks for your support!

## Compatibility

#### Version 2.0.0

The V2 is still available at [https://v2.jam-icons.com/](https://v2.jam-icons.com/)

## Changelog

Jam icons is following the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) with the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

- V3.1.0 - 44 new icons
- V3.0.0 - Set update
- V2.0.0 - New release with 896 icons
