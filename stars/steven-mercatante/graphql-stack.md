# GraphQL Stack Explanation

[https://graphqlstack.com](https://graphqlstack.com)

A visual explanation of how the various tools in the GraphQL ecosystem fit together.

I think GraphQL can be confusing, especially to newcomers, because of the large number of tools & libraries available for it. This chart aims to help folks see how the various pieces are connected. I've included the major players, but it's not an exhaustive list - feel free to contribute any omissions.

### Contributions

Is a library missing? Is there incorrect information? Please submit a PR! Most of the content is fed by `src/toolsData.js`.
