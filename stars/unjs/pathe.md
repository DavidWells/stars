## ‚ùì Why

For [historical reasons](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/larryosterman/why-is-the-dos-path-character), windows followed MS-DOS and used backslash for separating paths rather than slash used for macOS, Linux, and other Posix operating systems. Nowadays, [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file?redirectedfrom=MSDN) supports both Slash and Backslash for paths. [Node.js's built-in `path` module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) in the default operation of the path module varies based on the operating system on which a Node.js application is running. Specifically, when running on a Windows operating system, the path module will assume that Windows-style paths are being used. **This makes inconsistent code behavior between Windows and POSIX.**

Compared to popular [upath](https://github.com/anodynos/upath), pathe provides **identical exports** of Node.js with normalization on **all operations** and is written in modern **ESM/TypeScript** and has **no dependency on Node.js**!

This package is a drop-in replacement of the Node.js's [path module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) module and ensures paths are normalized with slash `/` and work in environments including Node.js.

## üíø Usage

Install using npm or yarn:

```bash
# npm
npm i pathe

# yarn
yarn add pathe

# pnpm
pnpm i pathe
```

Import:

```js
// ESM / Typescript
import { resolve, matchesGlob } from "pathe";

// CommonJS
const { resolve, matchesGlob } = require("pathe");
```

Read more about path utils from [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) and rest assured behavior is consistently like POSIX regardless of your input paths format and running platform (the only exception is `delimiter` constant export, it will be set to `;` on windows platform).

### Extra utilities

Pathe exports some extra utilities that do not exist in standard Node.js [path module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html).
In order to use them, you can import from `pathe/utils` subpath:

```js
import {
  filename,
  normalizeAliases,
  resolveAlias,
  reverseResolveAlias,
} from "pathe/utils";
```
