# Add authentication to a React Flux app

This is a sample that shows how you can add authentication to a React Flux app. Read more about it in [this blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/04/09/adding-authentication-to-your-react-flux-app/)

## Using it

Clone this repository as well as [the server](https://github.com/auth0/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) for this example.

First, run the server app in the port `3001`.

Then, run `npm install` on this project and run `npm run watch` to start the app. Then just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
