# Awesome Leadership and Management [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

## What This Is, and Where It Comes From
Since 2013-ish, [Joe Goldberg](https://twitter.com/bostonsteamer), who created the original document inspiring this list, read a crap-ton of books and articles about "leadership" and "management" and took notes along the way. He shared it with friends who were transitioning to management roles and eventually decided to open-source it. [Here you'll find Joe's still-public document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1O0OEsQpZcBcLheRlomDrmR2tyEpdRNFnjbLALmbH4/edit#heading=h.loq53mbwc6ut), which provides meatier summaries of the articles you'll find listed here as well as lots of supplementary notes.

*"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." — Sir Isaac Newton <br>
"If I have not seen as far, it is because giants were standing on my shoulders." — lots of people, including Leigh Caplan<br>
"A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when their work‘s done, her aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves." — Lao Tzu*

### Who is this for?
- Individual contributors (ICs) looking to move into a management role but not sure if it’s right for them

- ICs who recently moved into a management role

### Why should you read this or trust the authors for advice?
You shouldn’t. Much of this is self-contradictory. Some seemed like good advice at the time. Little of it is original, even less is written by me. Don’t read this cover-to-cover. Scan the Table of Contents and pick a topic you’d like to learn more about. Joe has highlighted the absolutely most essential content (a few dozen articles, six books, and a handful of videos, checklists, and slide decks).

### How can I submit a link or ask a question?
First off, we'd love that! For submissions, follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). For questions, go ahead and post an issue in our Issues Tracker. 

### How can I get more info on [missing topic]?
Please let us know via the Issues Tracker if there’s a topic you'd like this list to include.

### Did you write all this yourself? (Credit/Attribution)
Almost none of the content shared in this list is by the authors. Where there’s a link, the content below it is generally a summary of the linked webpage. When there’s no link, it’s either original content or gives credit/attribution. Some book summaries are from [Personal MBA](https://personalmba.com/), which Joe piloted and consulted on, but not to the extent where he is willing to take credit for its content.
