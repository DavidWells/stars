# PanWriter

PanWriter is a distraction-free markdown editor with two unique features:

1. Tight integration with pandoc for import/export to/from plenty of file formats (including HTML, docx, LaTeX and EPUB).
2. Preview pane that can show pages â€“ including page breaks etc. Layout adjustments are immediately reflected in the preview.

Read the **[MANUAL](https://www.panwriter.com/MANUAL.html)** for more info.

**[Download PanWriter](https://www.panwriter.com)**

- You also have to [install pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to export to most formats.
- If you're on macOS, see this [thread on how to bypass the security warning](https://github.com/mb21/panwriter/issues/33#issuecomment-2354944902).
