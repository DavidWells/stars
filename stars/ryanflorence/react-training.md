React Training
==============

For immersive React.js training check out my new job at http://reactjs-training.com

This is material I used for instructure's react training sessions when I worked there.

The main branch is gh-pages, so all of the examples in `code/` should
run at http://ryanflorence.github.io/react-training/code (but you'll have
to punch in the URL for now).


## Running the examples locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then interact with the examples at:

```
localhost:8080
```
