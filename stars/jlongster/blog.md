# jlongster.com

This is the raw source for my blog, [jlongster.com](http://jlongster.com/). I **don't** experiment with new libraries here anymore. In fact, sadly, this does not use React anymore.

If you are looking for my blog that supports server-side rendering with react, redux, and react-router, check out the [react-blog](https://github.com/jlongster/blog/tree/react-blog) branch.

This is just a stupid simple server that indexes posts off the filesystem.

**Use at your own risk.**
