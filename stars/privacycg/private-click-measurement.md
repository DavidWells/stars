## Introduction

A popular business model for the web is to get attribution and payment for clicks, for instance ad clicks that result in purchases or sign-ups. Traditionally, such attribution has been facilitated by user or device identifying cookies sent in cross-site HTTP requests. However, the same technology can be and has been used for privacy invasive cross-site tracking of users.

The technology described [in this draft specification](https://privacycg.github.io/private-click-measurement/) is intended to allow for click attribution, such as ad click attribution, while disallowing arbitrary cross-site tracking.

## Goals

* Support click attribution across websites.

* Preserve user privacy, specifically prevent cross-site tracking of users.
