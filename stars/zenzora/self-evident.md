Self Evident
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'it is said that' with 'I have no sources or evidence for this, but'

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions > Load unpacked extension. Select the `source`
directory and enjoy some quality self evidence.
