# webpack-long-term-cache-demo
A demo webpack config showing how to enable long-term caching using Webpack. Read [Long-term caching of static assets with Webpack](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/long-term-caching-of-static-assets-with-webpack-1ecb139adb95#.9ro7cpngr) for details.

## To enable long-term caching of static resources produced by webpack:

1. Use `[chunkhash]` to add a content-dependent cache-buster to each file.
1. Use compiler stats to get the file names when requiring resources in HTML.
1. Generate the chunk-manifest JSON and inline it into the HTML page before loading resources.
1. Ensure that the entry point chunk containing the bootstrapping code doesnâ€™t change its hash over time for the same set of dependencies.
1. Profit!

## How to run

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
