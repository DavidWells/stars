# `harper-obsidian-plugin`

The Harper plugin is a powerful, privacy-first grammar and spell-checking tool designed specifically for Obsidian users. Unlike many other grammar checkers, Harper operates entirely offline, ensuring your data remains secure while providing real-time, high-performance corrections. This plugin is ideal for writers, academics, and developers who value privacy and efficiency in their workflows.

## Key Features

### Privacy-Focused

- Harper runs entirely on your device, meaning no data is sent to external servers.
- Unlike tools like Grammarly or LanguageTool (when not self-hosted), Harper ensures complete ownership and confidentiality of your notes.

### Real-Time Grammar and Spell Checking

- The plugin automatically scans your text as you type, highlighting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and stylistic inconsistencies.
- Hovering over an error provides instant suggestions for corrections, making editing seamless.

### Lightweight and Fast

- Built with performance in mind, Harper delivers corrections in milliseconds without slowing down even large vaults.
- It has a minimal memory footprint compared to alternatives like LanguageTool, which can require significant resources.

### Open Source

- Harper is fully open source, allowing transparency and community contributions to improve its functionality.
- Developers can review the codebase or contribute directly via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/automattic/harper-obsidian-plugin).
